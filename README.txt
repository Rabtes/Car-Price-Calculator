"Our project focused on analyzing car data in Turkey, specifically the relationship between the model years of cars and their prices. We explored the use of linear regression as an initial approach but found that it was not suitable for our algorithm. Through experimentation and analysis, we discovered that other machine learning algorithms may be more appropriate for predicting car prices based on the available data. Our findings highlight the importance of considering alternative approaches in developing accurate prediction models for car pricing in the Turkish market."
